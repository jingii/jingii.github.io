:wave: Hello, I am Yi (Joy) Jing, a senior undergraduate student majoring in statistics at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/), within the [School of Management](http://en.business.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm). My academic journey has been fueled by a passion for the application of statistics and machine learning to solve real-world challenges, especially in healthcare. Currently, I am serving as a research intern at [DBMI](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu), Harvard, under the guidance and supervision of Prof. [Tianxi Cai](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/people/tianxi-cai).

I am actively in the process of applying for a Ph.D. program commencing in the fall of 2024. I look forward to the opportunity to further explore and deepen my knowledge in statistics and machine learning while collaborating with experts in the field.
