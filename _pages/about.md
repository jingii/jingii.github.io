Hello, I am Yi (Joy) Jing, a senior undergraduate student majoring in statistics at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/), within the [Department of Management](http://en.business.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm). My academic journey has been fueled by a passion for the application of statistics and machine learning to solve real-world challenges. I am planning to apply for a Ph.D. program in the fall of 2024. I look forward to the opportunity to further explore and deepen my knowledge in statistics and machine learning while collaborating with experts in the field.
